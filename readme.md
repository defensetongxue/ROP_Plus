## TODO:


We are currently facing a significant problem where the vessel segmentation model does not seem to be effective. I propose that the issue could be due to the differences between the pre-trained data used and the data provided for classification.

To address this issue, we could consider utilizing two potential methods: data augmentation (DA) or non-machine learning methods.
