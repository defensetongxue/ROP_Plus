# Method

In the related research, we find the the preplus dieases have the strong relation with the ROP. This means act as the foundation in diagnosing the ROP with the vessel.

# Story building
1. Practical pipe line or system
2. The previous work do not focus on the medicine standard that causes the result less helpful in the real world diease dignose
3. The system will guild the ophthalmologists to find the  demarcation line or ridge When it is not included in the images. and classifcation and (segmentation) the pathology landmark when they shown in the images.
# Code rebuild
## Rebuild the code for the coming task.

## Add the data augument task
Resample the rare class in ROP 2,3 stage which seems to get improvement in the original dataset with baseline method (Inception V3)

# data annotatiion
Discussing many times and determine the labeling steps.

## question:
There is a qustion about digital information for pregnant women and babies that will bring a lot of work for collaborators. She is curious about whether there is a plan for this data to be used.

# TODO
1. quality of the fundus image
2. extract of the end of the vessel
    1. the direction of the vessel
    2. something details like the middle part of the vessel will dismiss beacuse of the the environment or methods in photo taking
3. graduation paper
