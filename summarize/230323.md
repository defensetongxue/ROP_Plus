# visualization
The visualizations indicate that the model may be focusing on the blood vessels rather than the white line at the end of the vascular structure. This could be explained by the fact that in some ROP diagnosis standards, abnormalities in the blood vessels are considered a key feature of any stage of ROP. Furthermore, some studies have employed object detection models to detect the tortuosity of blood vessels in order to provide a more explainable result for ROP diagnosis.. However, from a human perspective, the white line is the most crucial feature.

# story telling
1. seriousness of ROP ... As tele-medicine based diagnostics are becoming wide spread, the amount of images that needs to be screened are too high and manual examination of these images become very difficult (new pipline or the algorithm)
2. Rely on certain Device and environment1. DA
3. explainable, dangerous of the black box
