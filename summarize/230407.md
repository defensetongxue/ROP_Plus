## object detection
There are three candidate models being considered for object detection:

1. ResNet18 backbone + Detect
2. YOLOv5
3. FR-UNet backbone + Detect

Only GPU models are available for options 2 and 3. Waiting for further information on these models ...
## consider to do
1. expand the dataset
2. using gpu and training better model in 2,3

## data mistaken
We apologize for the mistake in the previous data preprocessing. It appears that some of the original data was downloaded twice from Baidu Cloud, leading to the following issue:  
1. Some of the data involve in train dataset will be involved in the validation and test dataset making the performance higner

redownloading the data

## todo
1. run the experiment !!
