1. change the code style in vessel segmentation model
2. save the vessel data in dataset to accelerate the training

    note : we need to do is build an another pipline, in the beginning we select the img that need to do the vessel detection (all in this term), and create a dataloader for orignal data.To do so, a new Datasets class is need.
    in the classification task, we build a Dataset to change the dimension
3. replace one channel rather than all in orignal data
4. replace the classifier to fetch the need 
5. replace the vessel segmentation model
6.
