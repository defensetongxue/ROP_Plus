Compared to the traditional U-Net model, FR-Unet has a more complex framework and achieves higher scores on public vascular segmentation datasets.

To improve the robustness of the model, we have employed two basic tricks:
1. More datasets
2. Implementing more data augmentation techniques

For the data augmentation task, we have taken 100 images and generated 64x10^4 patches of size 48x48, compared with 20 to 10^4 as before
# classification task
Do not straightly replace orignal data with the result of Vessel Segmentation model. Try to replace a single channel like blue channel, because the shorter wavelength of blue light limits its ability to penetrate the surface tissues of the retina, resulting in lower levels of detail and contrast.
# hold
1. UDA for vessel segmenation [PaperLink](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00858https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00858)
# Todo
1. heat map for visualization
3. classification task
    1. Do not involved the positive labels for ROP individual.As the pathological features that may exist in these photos could become noise in the model.
    2. more classifier and model settings
# will do
1. more augumenation for orignal data
